# to-do-app

Welcome to the To-Do App repository!

This is a simple To-Do App that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The HTML laid out the basic frameworks for the assignment. I applied the Google Material Design standards to the CSS file. The JavaScript functions allow the user to add items to the list, as well as remove them.
